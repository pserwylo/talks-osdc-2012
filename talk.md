# My Choice:<br />Mobile phone via wireless<br />(i.e. None of the above)

# Presenter Notes

I'm not bit on electronics (yet).

I was trying to do this on the cheap, buttons/joysticks cost money.

I'm a programmer.

---

# Choice 3: Software stack

---

# For a hacker community...<br />...massive Windows users

---

# Preconfigured OS

## AdvanceCD

[http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/cd-readme.html](http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/cd-readme.html)

* LiveUSB/CD
* Emulator frontend

---

# Clean install + custom configuration

## Fast boot times

## Auto login

## Auto start emulator/launcher

## Auto start wifi + wireless controller server

--- 

# My Choice:<br />Arch Linux + IceWM<br />==<br />5 second boot time

---

# Choice 3: Games!

---

# Emulators

## MAME

## Atari

## (S)NES

## etc...

---

# Legality of emulating games

# Presenter Notes

Compare to homebrew talk last year.

Not as black and white as homebrew, which seems perfectly fine.

MAME devs are very concerned about this.
